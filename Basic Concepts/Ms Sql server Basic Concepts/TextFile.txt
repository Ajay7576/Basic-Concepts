Basic SQL Server Questions

1. What is SQL Server?
Ans:- A relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft, used to store and retrieve data as requested by other software applications.

2.What is a Database?
Ans:- A structured collection of data stored in a way that allows for easy access, management, and updating.

3.What is a Table?
Ans :- A collection of related data entries in a database, organized in rows and columns.

4.What are Rows and Columns?

Ans:- Row: A single record in a table.
Column: A field in a table that defines the type of data stored in each record.

5.What is a Primary Key?
Ans:- A unique identifier for a row in a table. No two rows can have the same primary key value.

6. What is a Foreign Key?
Ans:- A column or set of columns that establishes a link between data in two tables, ensuring referential integrity.

7.What are SQL Data Types?
Ans:- Types that define the kind of data that can be stored in a column (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATETIME, etc.).

8. What is a View?
Ans:- A virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query. It can simplify complex queries and provide a layer of security.

9.What is a Stored Procedure?
Ans:- A precompiled collection of SQL statements that can be executed as a single call to perform operations in the database.

10.What is an Index?
Ans:- A database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table, similar to an index in a book.

11.What is Normalization?
Ans:- The process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

12.What are the Different Types of Joins?
Ans:-

INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table records.

13.What is a Transaction?
Ans:- A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work, which must either all succeed or all fail.

14.What is SQL Injection?
Ans:- A code injection technique that exploits a security vulnerability in an application's software by executing malicious SQL statements.

15.What is the Difference Between DELETE and TRUNCATE?
Ans:-
DELETE: A DML command that removes rows from a table based on a condition and can be rolled back.
TRUNCATE: A DDL command that removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions; it cannot be rolled back.

16.What is a Temporary Table?
Ans:- A table that is created temporarily to store data for the duration of a session or a specific task.

17. What are Aggregate Functions?
Ans:- Functions that perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value, such as SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), etc.

18.What is the Difference Between UNION and UNION ALL?
Ans:-
UNION: Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements and removes duplicates.
UNION ALL: Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements and includes duplicates.

19.What is a Trigger?
Ans:- A special type of stored procedure that automatically executes in response to certain events on a table (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

20.How do you Back Up a Database?
Ans:- By using SQL Server Management Studio or executing a T-SQL command such as BACKUP DATABASE.

21. What is Subquery?
Ans:- A subquery is a SQL query nested inside another SQL query. It is used to perform operations that depend on the results of another query

22. What is Unique Key?
Ans. A unique key is a constraint in SQL that ensures all values in a column are unique across the table. Unlike a primary key, a unique key can accept null values

23. What is Joins?
Ans:- Joins are used in SQL to combine records from two or more tables based on related columns
